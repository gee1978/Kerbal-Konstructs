Kerbal Konstructs
=================

What is it?
-----------
Kerbal Konstructs is a reimplementation of the popular [KerbTown](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40374-WIP-KerbTown-v0-13-Beta-Place-static-buildings-cities-launch-sites-more!) mod by Razchek. medsouz's original goal was to remain completely compatible with KerbTown asset packs while also providing optimizations that are not present in the original mod. The goal of this fork is to provide new features as well as optimisations without concern for KerbTown compatibility. This fork abandons KerbTown but I acknowledge and credit the contributions.

FAQ
---
**Why not just contribute to KerbTown?**

KerbTown is very dead. If the original authors of that mod choose to continue it, I may pursue merging this fork back in. I probably won't. This will just keep going on its merry way.

**What about medsouz?**

This is a fork of his work and I consider medsouz a friend. His involvement with this fork and my relationship with him and our collaboration or the future of it isn't something you need to worry about.

**Why should I use this instead of KerbTown?**

You can use whatever you prefer.

However, asset packs for either mod won't necessarily work together seamlessly anymore as I am not remotely trying to maintain full compatibility with KerbTown.
